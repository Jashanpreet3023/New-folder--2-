            <p>Heavy-lift drones, capable of transporting 70 kg to 500 kg loads, are emerging as a transformative technology for efficient and cost-effective cargo delivery, particularly in remote and underserved areas. These drones are technically mature and await regulatory approval for certification. They also have the potential to bridge into people-carrying platforms like Advanced Aerial Mobility (AAM) and Urban Aerial Mobility (UAM). Several companies in the AAM space have recently announced plans to go public. Saudi Arabia sees an opportunity in heavy-lift drone technology to enhance access to critical supplies in challenging terrains, aligning with its Vision 2030 initiative to improve transportation infrastructure and the quality of life.</p>
